1.0.0


1.0.0:完成了编辑功能
1.0.1:增加了提取重复文本和批量替换一些语句的功能。

Question 1
 The last expansion for Legendary Mode,The text is in duelyst.js, not in index.json, it is very troublesome to translate, will you extract it to index.json?

Question 2
In the display, the text in the store interface and the game interface does not wrap.
In the collection interface and the card details interface, the display is normal. Can you solve it?
In duelyst2 I manually added \n for newline, the workload of legend mode is too much.

Question 3
Now I can only let players manually replace locales\en\index.js, if you want to officially launch the localization function, you can contact me, I will do translation work for free, I wrote a tool to do this.

There are not many Chinese players, but if you can help solve these problems, thank you very much
